# hello!
## our project
our project is a digital escape room that uses Gemini as a "dungeon master", and relays his answers to a discord bot, that sends them in the general channel in a server. The discord capability makes the game a multiplayer, and we wrote the code with that in mind.

## future additions
in the future, we plan to add a visualization system, and make this project more fleshed-out, with the functionality to reply to messages, send pictures, work with bot commands, and the like. 
We also plan to organize the code a bit, and make use of the file uploading system of the gemini api to upload prompts.

## about us
we are the Google Mentoring Progect team from Technoda, Hadera. I specifically am really bored at the moment and should definitely do homework.

## documentation
this part is a todo, sorry :(
